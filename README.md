# PCBS-Sentiment_Analysis_Python

## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to create a Sentiment Analysis classifier of Amazon food reviews. The dataset I am working is made of ~ 500,000 reviews from Oct 1999 to Oct 2012. The expected outcome of the project is a classifier able to predict the polarity (positive or negative) of the opinion of the reviewer.
If time, some further developments may include : 
- performance comparisons of different machine learning methods
- performance analysis of simple rule-based classifiers vs ML classifiers
- feature extraction of the most helpful reviews (as rated by the users).
