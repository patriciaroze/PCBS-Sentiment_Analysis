# Sentiment Analysis with Supervised learning models 

## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to compare the acuracy of three supervised learning models in a Sentiment Analysis classification task. The dataset I am working on is made of ~ 500,000 reviews of Amazon food products, written from Oct 1999 to Oct 2012. 

### Downloading the dataset
The dataset was too big to upload to Github, but you can download it here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JEipy9qa67FuMeqkL_uuLxQIwEEcBo3J/view?usp=sharing

To execute the script, create a folder named 'data' in your working directory (the folder containing my script). 
Download the csv

## 1. Exploring the dataset

The dataset I will be working on can be downloaded from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
(too big to be uploaded to github for now, currently looking for a solution to the problem). 

## 2. Pre-processing

## 3. Training

## 4. Testing
